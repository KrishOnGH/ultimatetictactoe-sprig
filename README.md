## Features

- **Win Conditions**: Win small boards to claim squares on the big board.
- **Game-Ending Conditions**:
  - Win three small boards in a row on the big board.
  - Fill the entire game board without a winner (draw).

## How to Play

1. Start the game on your Sprig Console.
2. Player X goes first.
3. Use the Sprig controls to select and place your marks.
4. The location of your move on a small board determines which board your opponent plays on next.
5. Win small boards to claim squares on the big board.
6. Continue playing until one player wins three small boards in a row or the game ends in a draw.

## Controls

- Use WASD buttons to navigate the boards and select squares.
- Press I to lock in your selected square.
- Press L to place your mark (X or O) in the selected square.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with Player X choosing any of the 81 empty spots on the board.
2. Each small 3×3 board corresponds to a square in the larger 3×3 game board.
3. Winning a small board claims that square for the player on the larger board.
4. The position of the last move in a small board determines which board the next player must play in.
5. If a player is sent to a board that is already won, they may choose any open board to play on.
6. The game ends when a player wins three small boards in a row, or if there is a tie (all small boards are filled).
